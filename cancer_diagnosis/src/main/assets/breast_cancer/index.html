                    treatment. So it's important to check your breasts regularly.</p>

                            <p>There’s no special technique and you don’t need training to check
                                your breasts.
                                Everyone’s breasts are different, so get to know how your breasts
                                normally look and
                                feel. That way, it’s easier to spot anything unusual.</p>

                            <p>Remember to check the whole breast area, including your upper chest
                                and armpits.</p>

                            <p>If you spot any changes to your breasts, make sure you get checked by
                                your doctor as soon
                                as possible.</p>

                            <h3>What should I be looking for?</h3>

                            <p>Lumps are important to look for, and can be the first symptom of
                                breast cancer for many
                                women. But there are other signs and symptoms you should look out
                                for.</p>

                            <p>Pain in your breasts is not normally a sign of breast cancer, but it
                                can be if it is
                                associated with other symptoms. While most pain is not usually a
                                symptom, it’s important
                                to look out for any pain that is unusual and persists over a period
                                of time.</p>

                            <p>It’s as simple as TLC:<strong> T</strong>ouch <strong>L</strong>ook
                                <strong>C</strong>heck

                            <h3><strong>TOUCH </strong>your breasts. Can you feel anything unusual?

                            <p>Can you feel a lump or swelling in the breast, upper chest or armpit?
                                You might feel the
                                lump, but not see it.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h3>CHECK anything unusual with your doctor.</h3>

                            <p>Have you felt or seen anything unusual? If so, make sure you get
                                checked out by your
                                doctor or nurse as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>It’s important to continue to check even if you are having regular
                                screening. </p>

                            <p>Having some of these symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you have
                                breast cancer, but it’s
                                important to get checked out if you are worried.</p>

                            <p>If your doctor thinks you need any further testing, they will refer
                                you to a breast
                                clinic to see a specialist.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h3>How often should I check my breasts?</h3>

                            <p>It doesn’t matter when you check your breasts, as long as you check
                                them regularly. This
                                could be every month, or every couple of months. You could check
                                while you’re in the
                                bath or shower, after the gym or before bed.</p>

                            <p>When you get to know your breasts, you might notice they change with
                                age, or at different
                                times of the month. For example, your breasts might feel tender and
                                lumpy around the
                                time of your period. You may also experience normal changes during
                                pregnancy, when your
                                breasts may get bigger and feel tender or sore.&nbsp;</p>
